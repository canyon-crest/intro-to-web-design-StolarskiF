<h2>Locations of my life</h2>
<p><img src="images/luxcity.jpeg" >I come from Europe. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons,_Belgium" target="_blank">Mons, Belgium. </a> I lived there for about 7-8 years, moving houses once every 1-2 years. Afterwards, I moved to a neighboring country called Luxembourg. Here I lived until 3 years ago I moved to the U.S. I come from Poland since my entire family is from there, I just was not born there. </p>

<h2>Family</h2>
<p><img src="images/CCA.jpg" >I have 2 Brothers, one is 22 called Stan, the other is 14 called Jan. I live with my parents as well, my mother and my father. My oldest brother lives in Europe and goes to University there, whilst my little brother goes to CCA as well. Our extended family still lives in Europe, such as my aunt and uncle who live in Luxembourg; where I moved from. I also have a dog, she is a westie called Peppa, like from Peppa Pig.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p><img src="images/Tennis_Racket_and_Balls.jpg" >I play sports such as Tennis, Golf, and Basketball, although none competitively; just for fun. My favorite sport is Badminton, although I don't play it much anymore. I play games with my brothers and friends sometimes, such as CoD. However during my free time, I usually just spend time studying or sleeping, especially during stressful times like finals or midterm weeks. Possibly not considered a hobby, but I enjoy hanging out with friends as well. We play sports, go out to eat, and play games sometimes, especially with my european friends whom I cannot hangout with anymore.</p>
